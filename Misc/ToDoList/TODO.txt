Currently Working:

Graphics:
Visualiser is working but the waveform needs to move to centre of the screen. 

Things to check: 
1. Can i centre the dry waveform reliabely? //
1a - refactor clean code
2a, what happens if i try and pull from the delay array when it isn't full

2. Can i show the wet waveform? 
-- Its this, once it's deleted and put somewhere else, it crashes
-- Crashes when put on a midi track
Test 1. Works on an audio track //
Test 1a. When on one audio track, the visualiser works
Test 2. Works on two audio tracks - it does not work on two audio tracks 
Notes:
Audio plugin crashes ableton when making two instances of the plugin while trying to log 'wet' data. 
Audio plugin crashes when i try and use it on a midi instance
Audio plugin crashes when i use it on an ableton 


3. Can i show two instances of the visualiser window object? (same waveforms)
4. Can i show two instances of the visualiser window object? (different waveforms)

Crashes: 
The effect crashes if I put it on when there is already audio playing
It could be a good idea to separate this project into two with 

//==========
17/11/2022: GUI On the backburner
Focus on audio effect part

//0. Refactor and then switch off GUI Code
//1. Introduce Fuzz Effect
//2. Introduce Nonlinear distortion effect
//3. Fix Low pass filter to start at 20Hz not 0 

18/11/2022: GUI On the backburner
Focus on audio effect part

//0. Add a toggle button to the GUI 
//1. Have that toggle button toggle the distortion part of the plugin
//2. Have a toggle button that toggles a full wave rectifier

19/11/2022: Refactoring

//0. Move all distortion effects to a waveshaping class
//1. Move all parameters into a managed structure

20/11/2022: Draw a diagram of the waveshaper 

//0. create a  Voltage transfer function display object
//1. draw a square inside the box
//2. draw a transfer function inside the box
//3. draw a cross using the path object ??

22/11/2022: Display input and output waveforms

Circular Buffer:
//0. give mCircBuffer 2x as many channels
//1. iterate through channels 1-2 and 3-4 separately
//2. pass over all channels 
//3. get information from channels 1-2 and 3-4 separately

Distortion: 
Find an asymetrical distortion that crosses the x axis smoothly
