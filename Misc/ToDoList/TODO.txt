Currently Working:
Visualiser is working but the waveform needs to move to centre of the screen. 

Things to check: 
1. Can i centre the dry waveform reliabely? //
1a - refactor clean code
2a, what happens if i try and pull from the delay array when it isn't full

2. Can i show the wet waveform? 
-- Its this, once it's deleted and put somewhere else, it crashes
-- Crashes when put on a midi track
Test 1. Works on an audio track //
Test 1a. When on one audio track, the visualiser works
Test 2. Works on two audio tracks - it does not work on two audio tracks 
Notes:
Audio plugin crashes ableton when making two instances of the plugin while trying to log 'wet' data. 
Audio plugin crashes when i try and use it on a midi instance
Audio plugin crashes when i use it on an ableton 


3. Can i show two instances of the visualiser window object? (same waveforms)
4. Can i show two instances of the visualiser window object? (different waveforms)
