Currently Working:
Visualiser is working but the waveform needs to move to centre of the screen. 

Things to check: 
1. Can i centre the dry waveform reliabely? //
2. Can i show the wet waveform? 
3. Can i show two instances of the visualiser window object? (same waveforms)
4. Can i show two instances of the visualiser window object? (different waveforms)
