PT1. Audio Effect

// ---- WET/DRY section ---- 

1. Get working throughput into ABLETON, inputs audio, outputs audio [Done]
2. Make a simple dummy audio effect and have that work [Done]
3. Create clean blend (wet/dry) functionality and test with dummy audio effect [Done]
4. Refactor
    a. Create wet/dry blend object as a separate file
    b. create simple effect object as a separate file
 
// ---- Gain Stage Section ----

4. Create a simple gain stage object and have it work on the wet signal
    Gain stage must: 
    -- Be representable in dB
    -- Be able to add +3dB if necessary
    -- Have some sort of trigger for if the signal going through is above +/-1
    [Use tutorial done for gain using the slope function for a whole block to reduce artefacts]
5. refactor appropriately
    -- This includes fixing any audio artefacts 

// ---- Fuzz Section ----

6. create a fuzz effect and have it work
7. make sure that hooks up to wet/dry
8. refactor

// ---- Overdrive ---- 

9. create a fuzz effect and have it work
10. make sure that hooks up to wet/dry
11. refactor

// ---- Filtering --- 

12. Create filter object and use for high/low pass 
13. Add bypass functionality which switches filter off/on 
14. Add Link functionality which links the highpass and lowpass filters to the same -3dB point
